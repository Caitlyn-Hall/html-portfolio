<h1>My Top 3 Favorite Recent Shows</h1>
<hr />
<h2>The Foundation</h2>
<p>This is my number one favorite show of all time. It's a science-fiction series with interspace travel.
    It begins with a girl who lives on a planet covered in water, in a radically traditional society which
    has outlawed mathematics and intellectual reasoning. The girl, Gaal, is a natural genius who will eventually,
    with the help of an old mathmatician, predict how the universe will inevitably fall into chaos and how the
    Foundation, a society they build, can support its recovery.</p>
<h2>The Witcher</h2>
<p>Although I enjoy this series and the world it builds, it zig-zags between intense action and emotion and a
    plain, uneventful storyline that drags on with no purpose. It takes you through a unique world of monsters
    and various humanoid species with magical abilities and medieval weaponry. It follows the prophecy of a
    powerful young sorceress, Ciri and her accidental, dad-like guardian, Geralt, who is a rough, old swordsman
    with magical abilities, otherwise known as a "witcher."</p>
<h2>The Sinner</h2>
<p>This series is the oldest on the list, but it never fails to hook me with its deep dive into the
     psychology of fictional victims and criminals who wrestle with trauma, seen through the eyes of Harry
    Ambrose, an empathetic investigator who always solves the mystery of the case.</p>
